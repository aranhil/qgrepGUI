## Installation

## Setting up in Visual Studio

1. After installing the extension, the toolbar can be opened from **View >> Other Windows >> qgrep Search Tool**.
2. You can also set up a shortcut for this from here:

   This will also grab the selected text in your current document before opening.

3. After this, you have to set up the folders that will be indexed. The window for this can be opened up from the lower left corner of the toolbar:

4. From here, you can add the folders and file filters. The "Gather from solution" button will automatically grab all the folders inside your solution. You can also select multiple folders at once.

5. After closing this window, indexing will begin automatically, and you can start searching.

### Search input

The search input has three toggles that can also be found in Visual Studio: Case sensitive, Whole word, and Regular expressions.

### Search results

The search results list can be interacted with the keyboard/mouse without the search input losing the focus. There is also a contextual menu with more options:

### Customize colors

Here you can switch between the Auto, Dark, and Light color schemes. If you're in Visual Studio, the Auto color scheme grabs the IDE's colors automatically, so you can use any custom theme you want:

You also have the option to override any color used in the currently selected color scheme.

### Advanced options

- **Include files**: Toggles the visibility of an input textbox that you can use to match the files that will be searched.
- **Exclude files**: Like the previous one, but this one excludes the matched files from the search.
- **Filter results**: Like the previous two, can be used to further filter the results, for both the path and the text
- **Show history**: This toggles the visibility of an icon on the input search box that shows all your recent searches.
- **Search while typing**: This will be on by default, but if you have performance issues, you can turn it off. Note that turning this off will no longer always keep the focus of the input textbox.
- **Group by**: File - groups the results by file; None - shows the results on a single line
- **Group expand**:If the previous option is set to File, this chooses how group expansion will be handled. Auto collapses all the results if there are too many.
- **Path style**: This changes how the paths will be shown in the results, it does NOT affect searching.
- **Trim spaces on copy**: This will trim any spaces and tabs surrounding the text when it's being copied.

### Search configurations

Advanced mode opens up the possibility to toggle between multiple search configs. After setting them up, they can then be switched on or off from the lower left corner of the toolbar.

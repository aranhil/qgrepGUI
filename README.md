*qgrep GUI* is a Visual Studio extension and GUI wrapper for [qgrep](https://github.com/zeux/qgrep) by Arseny Kapoulkine. As an indexing search tool, it's well-suited for large codebases, providing a user-friendly and responsive interface equipped with all the standard search tool features.

## Installation

Install the Visual Studio extension from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stefan-IulianChivu.qgrepSearchTool-x64) (for Visual Studio 2022) or from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stefan-IulianChivu.qgrepSearchTool-x86) (for Visual Studio 2019) and follow the setup instructions below.

## Setting up in Visual Studio

1. After installing the extension, the tool window can be opened from **View >> qgrep Search Tool**. It also comes with a shorcut already assigned (Alt+Shift+F), but if it's already assigned or you want to change it, you can do that from the **Customize shortcuts** window or, in Visual Studio, from **Tools >> Options >> Environment >> Keyboard**, the command name is **View.qgrepSearchTool**.

2. After opening the tool window, you have to set up the folders that will be indexed:

## Features overview

### Search Results
   The search results can be shown as list or grouped by file and there is also a contextual menu.

### History
   The history keeps all of your recent searches but it can also show all of your recently opened files from inside the tool.

</p>
      
### Open file
   You can also search for files using unordered keywords, using a different window that can be opened from **View >> qgrep Open File** or using the shortcut (Alt+Shift+I). You can change this shortcut as well from the **Customize shortcuts** window, but it can also be changed in Visual Studio, the command name is **View.qgrepSearchFile**.

</p>
      
### Customize colors
   There are three color schemes available: **Auto**, **Dark**, and **Light**. The **Auto** color scheme grabs the IDE's colors automatically, so you can use any custom theme you want. You also have the option to override any color used in the currently selected color scheme:

</p>
   
### Keyboard navigation
   You can cycle with the **Tab** key between the input TextBoxes and the search results. The **Down** key focuses on the results list. You can view the complete list with all the shortcuts and their key combination from the **Customize shortcuts** window:

</p>

They can also be changed in Visual Studio from **Tools >> Options >> Environment >> Keyboard**, all of the commands are prefixed with **qgrep.** and make sure to keep the same **qgrep Tool Window** context so that they only work when the tool window is focused.

## Installation

Install the Visual Studio extension and follow the setup instructions below.

## Setting up in Visual Studio

1. After installing the extension, the toolbar can be opened from **View >> Other Windows >> qgrep Search Tool**. It also comes with a shorcut already assigned (Alt+Shift+F), but if it's already assigned or you want to change it, you can do that from **Tools >> Options >> Environment >> Keyboard**, the command name is "View.qgrepSearchTool".

2. After opening the tool window, you have to set up the folders that will be indexed:

   If your projects have a format that can be parsed by MSBuild, you can use the **Gather from solution** button to automatically grab all the folders and file extensions from the solution.
